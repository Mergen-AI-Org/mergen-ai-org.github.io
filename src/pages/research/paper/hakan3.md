**Abstract**

Facing the urgent requirement for effective emergency management, our study introduces a groundbreaking approach leveraging the capabilities of open-source Large Language Models (LLMs), notably LLAMA2. This system is engineered to enhance public emergency assistance by swiftly processing and classifying emergencies communicated through social media and direct messaging. Our innovative model interprets user descriptions to analyze context and integrate it with existing Situation Reports, streamlining the alert process to government agencies with crucial information. Importantly, during peak emergency times when conventional systems are under stress, our LLM-based solution provides critical support by offering straightforward guidance to individuals and facilitating direct communication of their circumstances to emergency responders. This advancement significantly bolsters the efficiency and efficacy of crisis response mechanisms.
