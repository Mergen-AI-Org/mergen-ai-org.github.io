**Abstract**

Environmental disasters such as floods, hurricanes, and wildfires have increasingly threatened communities worldwide, prompting various mitigation strategies. Among these, property buyouts have emerged as a prominent approach to reducing vulnerability to future disasters. This strategy involves governments purchasing at-risk properties from willing sellers and converting the land into open space, ostensibly reducing future disaster risk and impact. However, the aftermath of these buyouts, particularly concerning land-use patterns and community impacts, remains under-explored. This research aims to fill this gap by employing innovative techniques like satellite imagery analysis and deep learning to study these patterns. To achieve this goal, we employed FEMA's Hazard Mitigation Grant Program (HMGP) buyout dataset, encompassing over 41,004 addresses of these buyout properties from 1989 to 2017. Leveraging Google's Maps Static API, we gathered 40,053 satellite images corresponding to these buyout lands. Subsequently, we implemented five cutting-edge machine learning models to evaluate their performance in classifying land cover types. Notably, this task involved multi-class classification, and our model achieved an outstanding ROC-AUC score of 98.86%
